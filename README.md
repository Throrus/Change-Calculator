# Change-Calculator
A simple program I wrote to get practice with the Decimal Module.


Hello, this is a very basic program that helped me learn a lot about manipulating numbers with python.

The change calculator will randomly generate a "price" for a non-existent item. The user is prompted to 
enter the "cash" they would like to use to pay for the item. The program will calculate the change due to the user.
It will print out a list of the bills and coins (in US currency) that will most efficiently make up the change due.

I'm sure the code could have been written much more cleanly, but it seems to work perfectly, and I got a lot of 
practice using the Decimal module.

Have fun using the program!
